# Overview

Python code to simulate the trajectory of massive and massless particles around a black hole through numerically solving the geodesic equations within the Schwarzschild metric. The solver is then applied to two tasks: the geodesics of massive particles are simulated within **Geodesic_Simulations**, forming an investigation of their properties such as orbital period, eccentricity and the effective potential; the geodesics of massless photons are simulated within **Ray_Tracing** and used to build a relativistic ray tracer to visualise the bending of spacetime within this Schwarzschild geometry, the result of which is displayed above, using the GAIA all-sky as a background.
